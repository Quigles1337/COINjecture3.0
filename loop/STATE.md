# COINjecture 3.0 Loop State

CYCLE: 4
PHASE: Phase 0 — Foundations and spikes
PACKET: P-004 — COMPLETE; GOVERNANCE INJECTION NEXT
BRANCH: docs/p004-closeout-audit-governance
REMOTE: https://github.com/Quigles1337/COINjecture3.0
CAPACITY_FLAG: cj2-blocked-on-external
CAPACITY_OBSERVED_AT: 2026-08-16 resume ruling plus CJ2 gate-state readback
STATUS: P004_MERGED_MAIN_GREEN_GOVERNANCE_INJECTION_IN_PROGRESS

## Ground-truth state

- Al ratified D1, D2, D14, D15, D16, and D17 in the 2026-08-15 live ruling; D9 and
  D10 were reconfirmed.
- Continuous-batch autonomous execution is authorized for P-001 through P-007 in
  order, subject to every tripwire and packet-boundary capacity re-check.
- P-001 merged through PR #1 at
  `8367de08bb3d3766bf49b9970eb3109fd1af4389`; exact-head PR CI and exact-merge-SHA
  mainline CI both passed all eleven jobs. Its ten crates remain empty boundaries with
  no protocol behavior.
- P-002 selected Wesolowski repeated squaring in a transparently derived imaginary-
  quadratic class group under D14. No production VDF crate or security/timing
  parameter was admitted; current pure-Rust options do not yet clear the full A9,
  evaluator, maturity, audit, and packaging bar.
- P-002 merged through PR #3 at
  `7ecba896c33c5a003bd6a9424f6742cd69c1156c`; exact-head PR CI and exact-merge-SHA
  mainline CI both passed all eleven jobs. `cj3-beacon` now exposes the bounded trait
  plus an opt-in iterated-hash devnet placeholder that compile-fails under the
  `cj3_testnet` tag.
- P-003 added the static problem-class contract, deterministic sampled-SIS prototype,
  exact safe-Rust checker, untrusted out-of-process LLL demonstrator, reproducible
  estimator/solver/verifier evidence, and provisional P-3/P-4 recommendations. It
  assigned no numeric class ID, codec, cadence, reward, or Sarah-owned value.
- P-003 merged through PR #5 at
  `e00561572c48137d535a44bcce55c04ad7db732b`; final-head run `31926469157` and
  exact-merge-SHA mainline run `31926645964` both passed all eleven D6 jobs. The
  sealed zero-finding security report is preserved at
  `loop/reports/P-003-security-scan.md`.
- P-004 added a bounded, class-neutral safe-Rust admission controller and a
  hash-pinned, read-only legacy calibration driver. SubsetSum, SAT, and TSP were
  rejected on sampled-hardness/checker-contract evidence; GraphColoring,
  Factorization, and SVP remain insufficient; Custom is not a concrete class.
- P-004 merged through PR #7 at
  `4644374f5073a929bf5ecc88c0e191f0d9bab1be`; exact-head run `31954357570` and
  exact-merge-SHA mainline run `31954588282` both passed all eleven D6 jobs. The
  inherited legacy-only `bincode 1.3.3` maintenance warning remains explicitly
  quarantined outside CJ3's workspace/runtime.
- `loop/reports/SPEC-ISSUES.md` keeps three G0/HUMAN interpretation issues open:
  conditional SIS-hardness wording, undefined `s_max`, and the missing normative
  SHAKE candidate-byte convention.
- The three pinned audit-tool caches are established on `main`; subsequent packet PRs
  can use the verified cache-hit path.
- GitHub reports `main` is not currently protected. P-001 documents the required
  contract in `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` and does not claim the setting is active.
- The COINjecture 2.0 agent queue remains blocked pending Sarah's GATE-1/GATE-2 answers;
  CJ3 may proceed only while that condition remains true. If those gates clear, the
  capacity flag becomes `remediation-priority` and CJ3 pauses immediately.
- `docs/RESEARCH_SURVEY.md` and
  `loop/PROMPTS/AUTONOMOUS_BUILDER.md` were supplied for the first governance commit.
- P-008 remains blocked on the exact Al-supplied public frontend repository URL.
- P-101 remains blocked on Gate G0.

## Next action

1. Commit the P-004 merge/calibration closeout at this packet boundary.
2. Process Al's non-preempting governance injection: preserve the exact supplied
   audit matrix, apply ratified AMEND-1/2/3 to the governing documents, record the
   LEDGER overlay, and append approved/unblocked P-009.
3. Make P-009's first action the durable copy of both supplied audit sources into
   `loop/evidence/`, preserving and recording exact hashes before analysis.

No frontend URL may be inferred for P-008, and no Al- or Sarah-owned TBD may be
filled.
